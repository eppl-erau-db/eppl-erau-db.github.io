Jose is a 9-year U.S. Army veteran. Five years ago, he made the leap from military service to chase his passion for physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, where he earned his Bachelor’s in Engineering Physics, focusing on Spacecraft Instrumentation. Along the way, he discovered a deep interest in AI and robotics, which quickly became the center of his studies. Now, he is continuing this journey by working toward a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
