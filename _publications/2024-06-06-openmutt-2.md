## Abstract

The OpenMutt platform is a modular, robotic quadruped for use as a testbed for a variety of research opportunities to increase multidisciplinary research. The OpenMutt quadruped allows for a low-cost testbed for actuator drive design, biomimicry, and instrumentation. The current design is intended to be modular and facilitate different research disciplines with the usage of a robust 13:1 cycloidal actuator, modular feet, and multiple mounting points for the investigation of various sensing modalities and hardware packages.
