The NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super is a game-changer in the world of embedded AI and robotics. With increased VRAM and a more affordable price point, this upgrade is set to increase our lab's prototyping capabilities and individual projects. We often start with an idea, and are eager to get to work, even before funding is allocated. Single-board computers like this are extremely useful for these phases, and are often continually used. 

## Key Benefits

### Increased VRAM
- The additional VRAM allows for more complex AI models to be run locally without memory constraints. 
- Enables faster processing of high-resolution images, video streams, and larger datasets.
- Reduces dependency on external cloud resources, which improves efficiency and security.

### Decreased Price
- The more affordable price makes it accessible for more students and researchers to integrate into their projects.
- Facilitates scaling by enabling multiple Jetson devices in a single project without budgetary constraints.

## Impact on Our Prototyping and Projects

### Advanced Robotics
- The improved computational capabilities allow for real-time object detection and decision-making in robotics projects.
- Enables seamless integration of sensor data for better control and navigation.

### Prototyping
- Faster and more efficient testing cycles due to reduced processing bottlenecks.
- Ability to prototype with AI models that were previously too resource-intensive for compact devices.
