  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    EPPL provides unique opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from various departments — including Engineering Physics, Aerospace Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering — to gain hands-on experience in innovative research supported by industry partners and grants. The lab fosters collaboration across diverse fields to address some of today’s most pressing technological challenges.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Research</h2>
  <p>
    Since its foundation in 2015, EPPL’s research has grown from a focus on in-space propulsion systems for spacecraft to a broad range of high-tech industrial applications. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Robotics and embodied AI</li>
    <li>Control systems and intelligent automation</li>
    <li>Cold gas and steam propulsion</li>
    <li>Drones' swarm control</li>
    <li>Industrial thermomechanical process optimization</li>
    <li>Emerging fields such as quantum systems control and quantum computing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    EPPL has contributed to several NASA and industry-supported projects, delivering innovative solutions that push the boundaries of research and engineering.
