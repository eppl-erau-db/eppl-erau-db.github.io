Directions for adding another webpage

Step 1: Add a collection in the configuration code for the new webpage (mimic the other pages)
Step 2: Beneath where the collections are, add a page following the same format at the others; make sure the "type" is the same name as your new collection
Step 3: Create an html (or md, it doesn't matter) for your webpage title
    follow the same format as the "projects.html" file but make sure the site.____ is site.[new collection name]
    permalink should also be the same as the collection/page
Step 4: go to "_data" -> "navigation.yml"
    add a title: [the title you entered in step 2]
    add a url that matches your permalink
