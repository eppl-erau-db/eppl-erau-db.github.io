    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        NEXA, Navigating Enhanced Exploration Assistance, is a pioneering initiative that integrates advanced artificial intelligence with drone technology for residential security and property monitoring. NEXA aims to develop a fully autonomous drone-based AI system capable of piloting, identifying potential threats, and providing real-time alerts to homeowners and authorities. The system's core is an AI platform designed for seamless integration with commercially available drone hardware. High-resolution cameras and secure communication modules enable accurate, round-the-clock surveillance, even in adverse weather or lighting conditions. This is achieved by implementing deep learning models using computer vision model architectures (Ultralytics YOLO) and embedded computing platforms (NVIDIA Jetson) for real-time object detection and classification.
