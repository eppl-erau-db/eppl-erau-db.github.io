AMIGO, Autonomous Machine for Inspecting Gas and Operations, spawned through the lab's partnership with [Steam Solutions](). We are exceeedingly thankful not only for their sponsorship of this project, but their continued support of the EPPL. The team, consisting of Bryan Gonzalez, Jose Castelblanco, and Gabriel Rodriguez were tasked with developing a sensor suite for the Unitree Go2 quadruped, enabling autonomous navigation, anomaly detection, and communication. Spearheading the integration of Nav2, Jose has successfuly enabled autonmous navigation in 2D, while Bryan has integrated AI object detection adn gas sensors to the suite. Gabriel, on the other hand, has focused on deploying reinforcement learning policies for dynamic locomotion and 3D navigation. 

Below is the current configuration of the AMIGO:
